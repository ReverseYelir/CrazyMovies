# CrazyMovies
This is my first web app utilizing both express and ejs partials. The project's purpose was to learn how to make API calls, organized
information received from the API calls, create non-static HTML pages. and also for some CSS practice. Crazy movies takes in a movie name 
and finds similar titled movies.The release date, title, and movie poster are displayed. Each movie gets it's own div element and is 
injected into results.ejs, which is rendered once a search is conducted.
